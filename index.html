<h1>GpLua2x</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GpLua2x is a port of the
<a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua scripting language</a>,
including a small wrapper to access some functions of
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>, for the
<a href="http://www.gp2x.co.uk">GP2x</a>.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

>gplua2x-VERSION.tar.gz</a></p>

<h2>Lua Interpreter</h2>
<p>The binary gplua2xrun can be used to run stand-alone Lua
applications/games on the GP2x.

<h2>Embedded Lua</h2> 
<p>If you just want to use Lua to do some scripting within an
application mainly written in C or C++, you can link with the
included liblua.a for GP2x. For testing on your development
system an ordinary Lua 5.1 installation can be used instead.
If you use some of the functions of the SDL wrapper you also
need to link with libsdl and libsdl-image from the
<a href="http://www.open2x.org/open2x/index.html">open2x project</a>.</p>

<h2>Compiling for Linux</h2>
<p>To compile for a Linux development host, you need to have
development libraries for Lua 5.1, SDL 1.2 and SDL-image 1.2 installed.
Run <code>make linux</code>.
</p>

<h2>Compiling for FreeBSD</h2>
<p>Similar to if you want to develop on Linux, for FreeBSD you need
to install the ports of Lua 5.1, SDL 1.2, and SDL-image 1.2, then
compile using <code>gmake freebsd</code>.</p>

<h2>Compiling for GP2x</h2>
<p> Compilation for
the GP2x is easiest to do with the included Makefile and
the toolchain and libraries from the
<a href="http://www.open2x.org/open2x/index.html">open2x project</a>,
and the
<a href="http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.2.tar.gz">source for Lua 5.1.2</a>.
The Lua sources should be placed in a directory called <code>lua</code>
in the directory with the gplua2x files.
You need to patch Lua using the included diff file to make it compile
properly for the GP2x. Run <code>make gp2x</code>. Note that binaries
for the GP2x are included. There is no need to compile your own unless
you modify the source (gplua2x.c and related files, or Lua itself).
